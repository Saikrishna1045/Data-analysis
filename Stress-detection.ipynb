      "she still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, i'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. i do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. it's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) i just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. my questions are: should i just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? and regardless of this, should i start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?\n",

      "so, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, i'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. we had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. we involved cps, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. after their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.\n",
